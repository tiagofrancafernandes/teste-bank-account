> Hi Tiago França Fernandes, how are you doing?

>
> Now it's time to show everything you know and your full potential through the challenge.
>
> Take-home assignment
>
> Implement the following API in the simplest way you can.
> Durability *IS NOT* a requirement, that is, you don’t need to use a database or persistence mechanism.
> The main goal of this exercise is to create a common ground to conduct the interview process.
> The API consists of two endpoints, GET /balance, and POST /event. Using your favorite programming language, build a system that can > handle those requests, publish it on the internet, and test it using our [automated test suite](http://ipkiss.pragmazero.com).
>
> After getting green light from our test suite, please submit bellow the source code for your solution to continue the interview > process.
>
> Keep in mind that
> There is no hidden agenda, if you code passes the tests, and you are happy about it: you are done;
> Pay attention to the package/directory structure, naming and encapsulation;
> Separate your business logic from the HTTP transport layer;
> Keep your code simple, do not try to anticipate anything that is not part of the spec;
> Keep your code malleable, we may ask for modifications;
> AGAIN, Keep your code malleable, we may ask for modifications;
> Use version control, we would love to see your step-by-step process;
> Take your time, don’t rush it;
>
> We wish you all the best!
